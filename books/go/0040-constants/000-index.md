Title: Constants

Go supports constants of character, string, boolean, and numeric values.

Constant basics:

@file index.go sha1:4052c4cd6d44e700e0f1ea22a63fab7c03bcd979 goplayground:3ZHY3nG0GKp

Constants can be used like variables, except for the fact that the value cannot be changed. Here's an example:

@file index_2.go output sha1:52ef5d6bf9bb944f7c51c3277067be7e02d1919b goplayground:jBjzn1DX-H2

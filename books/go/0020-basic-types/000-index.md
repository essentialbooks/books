Go supports all the basic types that you would expect from a statically typed language:
* booleans
* fixed-sized signed and unsigned integers
* floating-point numbers
* characters
* strings
* constants
* arrays (and slices)
* maps (known as dictionaries or hash tables in other languages)
* structures

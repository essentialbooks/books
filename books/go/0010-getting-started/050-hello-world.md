Create the file `hello_world.go` and run it with `go run hello_world.go`.

@file hello_world.go output sha1:0f07d9089d8d2b71532099d2524664c3399ae357 goplayground:7vin2BK8_A6

Once you are happy with the code, it can be compiled to an executable with `go build hello.go`.

On Windows this will create `hello.exe` executable.

On every other OS, this will create `./hello` executable.

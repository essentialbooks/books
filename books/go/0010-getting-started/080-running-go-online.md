Title: Run Go in online playground
Id: 27470
---
To test small snippets of Go code, you can use [The Go Playground](https://play.golang.org) or nicer [The Go Play Space](https://goplay.space/).

Playground has some limitations:
* it only supports the standard library. You can't use third party libraries
* networking, file i/o is not available
* time is simulated

By using the 'Share' button in the playground you can get a permanent link to the code snippet and share it with others.

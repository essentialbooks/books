Title: Create array
Id: 1295
---
An array in Go is an ordered collection of same-type elements.

The basic notation to represent arrays is to use `[]` with the variable name.

Creating a new array looks like `var array = [size]Type`, replacing `size` by a number (for example `42` to specify it will be a list of 42 elements), and replacing `Type` by the type of the elements the array can contains (for example `int` or `string`)

Below is a code example showing different ways to create an array in Go.

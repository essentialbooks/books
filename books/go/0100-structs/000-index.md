Title: Structs

A struct is groups related variables into a single entity.

Additionally, structs can have methods, similar to classes in C++ or Java.

Unlike classes in C++ or Java, structs don't implement inheritance. You can achieve some of the code re-use with [struct embedding](a-1256).

[Zero value](a-6069) of `struct` is a struct whose fields are set to their respective zero values.

Basics of structs:
